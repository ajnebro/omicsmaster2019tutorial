# Tutorial: "Multi-objective optimization with metaheuristics. Applications to Bioinformatics"

This site contains stuff to be used in the tutorial I will give in the Omics Data Analysis Master of the University of Vic on 31th January 2019.

In this tutorial we will learn:
* What are metaheuristic techniques and why they are useful.
* Issues related to optimizing problems having more tan one objective function (multi-objective optimization problems).
* How to use the [jMetalPy optimization framework](https://github.com/jMetal/jmetalpy) to solve both single and multi-objective optimization problems.
* To assess the quality of aligned sequences with the [pyMSA software](https://github.com/benhid/pyMSA). 
* To apply metaheuristics to deal with multi-objective formulations of the multiple sequence alignment problem using [Sequoya](https://github.com/benhid/Sequoya).
